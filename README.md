### What I learned

This section to recap over some of my major learnings while working through this project.

#### CSS grid
This project was the catelist for me spend a significant amount of time relearning CSS grid in a more indepedt level. With the new knowled I was able to simplify my previous code and make the website look more like the design file.

Grid garden was the way I got introduce to learning CSS grid by playing a game with a story line. Grid critters was one of the best resource I found that had the tutorial on how to use it, and challanges and practice that made me feel confident using CSS grid. 

#### Significant advantages for this project: 

- using grid-template instead of grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas.

- Having a deeper understanding on how the grid works, what is capable of, and its limitation.
  Inspire me to change the layout from:
  - define white space vs justify, and align content 
  -  having a complex layout vs having a multi simple layout
  -  fr units only vs using multi-units when it makes sense for the layout
     -  min()
     -  minmax()
     -  min-content
     -  auto
     -  fr

Mobile Complex
```css
.stats {
   // layout
    display: grid;
    grid-template: min-content 4rem min-content 2rem min-content 4rem min-content 3rem / 2rem 1fr 2rem;
    grid-template-areas: 
        "header header header"
        ". . ."
        ". tittle ."
        ". . ."
        ". message ."
        ". . ."
        ". list ."
        ". . ."
    ;
}
```

Mobile simplify
```css
.stats {
   display: grid;
    grid-template:
        "header" auto
        // "header" auto
        "content" minmax(29.3rem, auto)
        / min(88%, 53.7rem)
    ;
    justify-content: center;
    align-content: center;
}
```
Desktop Complex
```css
.stats {
   grid-template:  8rem min-content 2rem min-content 4rem min-content clamp(1rem, 2vw, 5rem) / 7rem 1fr 10rem 2fr;
        grid-template-areas: 
            ". . . header"
            ". tittle . header"
            ". . . header"
            ". message . header"
            ". . . header"
            ". list . header"
            ". . . header"
        ;
        text-align: left;
        height: min-content;
        // height: (max-content);
        // max-height: 43.8rem;
        max-width: min(80%, 110rem);;
}
```

Desktop simplify
```css
.stats {
   grid-template:
        "content header " min-content
        /
        min(45vw, 61rem) 
        min(45vw, 61rem) 
    ;
}
```
